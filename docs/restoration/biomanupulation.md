#Overview
 1. Background of lake polution: population increase -->demand for food and ecosystem services increases-->anthropogenic stressors on all ecosystems
 2. Background of Lake restortion:freshwater ecosystems faces multistressers, and led to many biossessement, biomonitoring and restoration, and gained progress
 3.Eutrophication will still be the major issue for coming period and the problems including turbid water, toxic cyanobacteria blooms, biodiversity loss and changes in biological community structure and ecosytem functioning( Carpenter et al., 1999, Jeppesen et al., 2001)
 4. Internal loadings has been taken care of in developed area but in most developing countries, reducing external loading is still a first step towards lake restoration. This step should have high priority(Cooke, 2005)
 5. The resilience during lake restoration: internal P, fish community and delay of returning of macrophytes
 6. Removing of zooplanktivirous and benthivorous fish is much more efficient than introduce piscivorous fish
